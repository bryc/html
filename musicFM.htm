<h1><span>FM Tests</span></h1>
<p>Hello. This page is about FM synthesis. In particular, I am evaluating VST synths to see which ones get closest to the characteristic FM in Yamaha's classic synths (DX series). There are many advanced synths today which utilize FM, but they are basically overkill. I like the sound of classic FM and would like to capture that sound in my own softsynth some day. So this is me getting cozy with FM synthesis.

<!--<p>I've done a bit of experimenting before starting this article, and found that envelope generators play the biggest part of shaping the sound in FM (specifically the modulators). Volume or “Attentuation” of operators are also quite important. On modulators, they can the color of sound like a filter. Feedback (self-modulation) is also a characteristic feature of Yamaha FM. Frequency ratio multipliers are another big contributing factor to the sound color, and must be constrained to harmonic ratios to retain stable pitch tones. Some FM synths don't have these ratios which makes them less useful for harmonic sounds. I will be evaluating these aspects for each plugin. -->


<p>To demonstrate the various FM synths, I'm using an excerpt of <i>Passing Breeze</i> from the arcade game OutRun. With each plugin, I aim to get as close to the same 'feel' as the instruments in that song. The notes are sequenced directly from the game. It's a rather well-done track using the YM2151 (OPM) soundchip. The composer Hiroshi Kawaguchi employed a chorus effect by playing the melody with three slightly detuned voices, however to simplify things, I am only using a single voice on the lead, so it will sound cleaner than the original. All the demos have an FX stack containing a <i>very</i> light chorus, reverb/delay and a maximizer/limiter.

<p>Let's start off by looking at some plugins which actually emulate the soundchips closely.
<h2>VOPMex</h2>
<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-vopm.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - VOPMex</span></div>

<p>VOPMex uses a YM2151 (OPM) emulator, so it's very close to the real thing. It's quite accurate as well, but it hasn't really been updated in years, and plays an octave higher than it should, but it's open source. I used it in my track <a href=https://soundcloud.com/bryc/shoulders-of-giants>On the Shoulders of Giants</a>.

<p>It sounds just like the game, but without the drums or chorus.

<h2>GENNY</h2>
<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-genny.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - GENNY</span></div>
<p>GENNY emulates a YM2612 + PSG from the Sega Genesis. It's beta vaporware, full of bugs, but seems to work for the most part. It is a very similar chip that sounds nearly identical to YM2151 when not using special features.

<p>The sound is a bit more distorted/scratchy than VOPM, especially in the lead. Probably a bug in GENNY. The operators are mis-labelled as well, and velocity sensitivity is screwed. At the very least, the instrument data is partly transferable so it sounds similar. Decreasing <code>TL</code> slightly in OP3&4 (mislabelled C1/C2) will eliminate the distortion to the point where it sounds indistinguishable from VOPM. But to highlight the bug, the audio above reflects the 1:1 translation of the patch.

<h2>Dexed</h2>
<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-dexed.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - Dexed</span></div>
<p>Dexed is an emulation of the original Yamaha DX7. It's easy on CPU due to not being a "real" emulator like the two above, yet it's still very accurate. It's also open source (like VOPM) which is always nice. I used <a target=_blank href="http://dxconvert.martintarenskeen.nl/">DXconvert</a> to convert the OPM data to the sysex format Dexed understands. It sounds quite off in the MarkI or OPL engine, only the Modern 24-bit engine sounds correct (Raph Levien's original engine). Go figure.

<p>It's much smoother than the original, but it gets close and is higher fidelity. It's quite interesting how effective conversion between different FM synths can be, despite having different parameter ranges. I tried converting DX100 presets to YM2151, and they ended up a little muted. They seem to sound better in Dexed, after conversion, which is surprising since I thought DX100 has more in common with YM2151 than DX7.

<hr>

<h1><span>Free FM synths</span></h1>
<p>Now that we've been spoiled by the top contenders, let's look at some other plugins that have their own flavor of FM, and see how they compare.

<!-- I will evaluate how close they can get to typical Yamaha FM sounds, as well as note any enhanced features that go beyond classic Yamaha FM, such as additional feedback, waveforms and algorithms/matrixes. So it wont be all bad. -->

<h2>JuceOPLVSTi</h2>

<p>This one is also an emulator, this time of the OPL3 (YMF262) chip. It has some significant limitations that make it incompatible with previous chips. The envelopes have less resolution, and each instrument consists of only 2 operators. To make up for these limitations, the OPL3 chip has additional waveforms for operators. There is also a special 4-op mode, but it's not usable in this plugin, and there's only four 4-op algorithms anyway (YM2151/YM2612 have 8).

<p>Despite its limitations, it still uses the same FM process, so I get somewhat close in the following example:

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-juceopl3.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - JuceOPLVSTi</span></div>

<p>This actually highlights some interesting aspects of how algorithms work. All but the bass in the original use algorithm 5 (the bass uses algorithm 3). Algorithm 5 is really just two layers of 2-op FM, the same that exists in OPL3. That is, they're basically two 2-op instruments played together, but have only one feedback loop etc. The <b>Bell sound</b> combines a bell with a muted brassy sound underneath it. We can model the pure bell-like sound, but lose the brassy part. The <b>Lead sound</b> is quite close in particular, due to containing a very quiet woodwind sound at a lower octave. Loss of the second layer in the lead is almost unnoticable since it's so underpowered in the original. The chords and bell suffer a bit, since they aren't as "rich" as the original. And as for the bass, we can't get too close because there is more than one modulator being used in algorithm 3. But it still sounds good for an OPL3 rendition.

<h2>VST2413</h2>

<p>VST2413 is an emulator of the YM2413 (OPLL) chip. It implements the same 2-op FM synthesis as JuceOPLVSTi, but only has 2 waveforms instead of 8 (specifically sine and half-sine). So we are more limited here. It's also pretty noisy and slightly out of tune.. wouldn't recommend it.

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-vst2413.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - VST2413</span></div>

<h2>mda DX10</h2>

mda DX10 is a 2-op FM synth with a peculiar flavor of FM. I would consider it overly metallic or plasticy. It just seems incapable of doing smooth FM sounds, and seems more suited for like acid techno or something like that. It lacks a feedback loop feature and has a strange/incomplete envelope implementation, which makes it basically impossible to do a decent brass sound.

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-dx10.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - DX10</span></div>

<p>The lead ends up sounding more like a harmonica rather than a trumpet, and the bass sounds more like a farty 'donk' patch. That's the best I can do with this thing and it just doesn't sound like even the OPL.

<h2>Vivaldi MX</h2>
<p>Vivaldi MX implements 2-op FM, but cheats by allowing up to 4 layers of 2-op instruments. Using two layers achieves similar results to algorithm 5 in YM2151, so I opted for that. However I used three layers to do the bass, since it's quite hard to get anywhere near the original. Vivaldi MX is the updated version of Vivaldi, which has twice the polyphony, features multitimbriality, and a couple of other stuff that doesn't matter too much.

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-vivaldi.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - Vivaldi MX</span></div>  

<p>With enough finessing, it can get somewhat close to the Yamaha's. However the attack and decay on the envelopes just isn't as punchy. I can't make a satisfying brass or bass sound (even OPL3 sounds better), and since there's only one decay rate and no curved envelopes, I can't get the same swell used in the original chords (besides using automation etc but that's beyond the scope here).

<h2>Uno FM</h2>

<p>This one is quite strange. At the surface it seems to be 2-op FM, but it has three sets of modulators and one carrier. So it may in fact be a <b>very</b> limited 4-op. They all have independent 'volume' and 'pitch' sliders, but share a modulation ADSR envelope and a FM amount slider. Then the carrier has its own amplitude ADSR envelope. Sadly, it has a very flat, metallic sound, only marginally better than DX10 I would say (maybe even worse to some ears).

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-unofm.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - Uno FM</span></div>

<p>This is pretty much the best I could get out of it, but it doesn't sound very good or compare to the YM2151.

<h2>JewelSynth</h2>
<p>This is a 2-op synth, made by same creator of Vivaldi. It's mostly GUI-oriented, but I thought I'd explore its sound. 

<h2>FM-Four</h2>
<p>A 4-op synth with some odd limitations. No feedback loop, and no individual modulator envelope loops..

<h2>Ganymed</h2>
<p>A 4-op synth. Big brother to Vivaldi. I think it also cheats by having two layers, but we will only be using one layer.


<hr>

<h2>FMMF</h2>
<p>This one seemed a bit odd, so I want to do this one here.

<h2>Panzertank PM4</h2>
<p>Another oddity to get out of the way.

<h2>GTG FM4</h2>
<p>A 3-op synth. Seemed ok at first glance but we'll have a look.

<h2>K200</h2>
<p>Another one to do.

<hr>

<h2>eFemme</h2>
<p>This one seemed good. I want to do this one a bit further in, after I get a bit experience from the others, to truly evaluate it.

<h2>Purple</h2>
<p>A 4-op synth with many buttons and possibly some bugs. It has 3 versions as well, so leaving it to the end here.

<hr>

<h2>discoDSP Phantom</h2>
<p>This is a commercial 4-op FM synth. Also want to have a look at this one

<h2>VX7</h2>
<p>An unreleased beta/demo, has some missing features. However, it's 6-op and is supposed to model the Yamaha SY-77. Algorithms don't seem interchangable. And the FM engine seems a bit weak.. But I want to do this one here before moving up into the freeform 6-ops.

<h2>Six / Double Six</h2>
<p>Another one I want to get out of the way here. It's 6-op but uses 32 DX7 algorithms. Would like to determine the differences between Six Full and the various Double Six's, to see which is the definitive version.

<h2>FMHeaven</h2>
<p>6-op, free-form algorithms in a modulation matrix. A bunch of waveforms.

<h2>Oxe FM</h2>
<p>6-op, free-form algorithms in a modulation (half?) matrix. A handful of waveforms

<h2>Foorius</h2>
<p>4-op, free-form algorithms in a modulation matrix. Has deep waveshaping capabilities. Tons of envelopes and LFOs.

<h2>NI FM7</h2>
<p>Not free, but is a classic, powerful softsynth worth checking out. 6-op (?), free-form algorithms in a modulation matrix. A bunch of waveforms.

<hr>

<p>So that's pretty much it for simple or free FM synths. FM7 is really cutting it close, but it may still qualify. It would be interesting to see how a lot of the 6-op synths stack up to the <b>AFM</b> sounds from Yamaha SY-77 (but not the AWM2 part). Yamaha also released an 8-op FS1R, which also ended up as the basis for the FM-X engine in Montage (which also uses AWM2). I also left out "Xen-FMTS", because it uses weird intonation systems and stuff.

 <p>There are more synths which utilize FM, but they go beyond what is typical of classic Yamaha FM (and sometimes combine different synthesis), but should be mentioned here as well.

<ol>
    <li>FM8 (6-op, pure FM? with tons of advanced functions)
    <li>Sytrus (6-op, FM/RM/Subtractive)
    <li>Nemesis (4-op "NeoFM", FM/Additive/Formant/Wavetable/Waveshaping/Phase distortion) - quite a monster
    <li>Rhino (6-op, FM/Additive/Waveshaping/soundfont/Analog)
    <li>Toxic Biohazard (6-op, FM/Subtractive)
    <li>Toxic 2.5 (6-op, FM/subtractive) - worth mentioning separately 
    <li>LinPlug Octopus (8-op)
    <li>Aurora FM (6-op, Pure DX7-like FM with DX11 waveforms + more modulations)
    <li>u-he Bazille (4-op, FM/Phase distortion/Fractual Resonance? + full modular cables + more)
    <li>Cypher (3-op, FM/waveshaper and some stuff.)
    <li>Rob Papen Blue II (6-op, FM/Subtractive/Phase distortion/Waveshaping/additive?)
    <li>RedLion (8-op, $80! rather simple, only 12 algorithms but has wave knobs..)
    <li>Portafm (2-op) - extremely polished OPLL emulator, worth looking into?
</ol>
