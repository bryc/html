<h1>FM Tests</h1>
<p>Hello. This page is about FM synthesis. In particular, I am evaluating VST synths to see which ones get closest to the FM achieved in Yamaha DX chips. There are many advanced synths today which utilize FM, but they are way overkill. I like the sound of classic FM and would like to make my own softsynth one day. So this is me getting cozy with FM synthesis.

<p>I've done a bit of experimenting before starting this article, and found that envelope generators play the biggest part of shaping the sound in FM (specifically the modulators). Volume or “Attentuation” of operators are also quite important. On modulators, they can the color of sound like a filter. Feedback (self-modulation) is also a characteristic feature of Yamaha FM. Frequency ratio multipliers are another big contributing factor to the sound color, and must be constrained to harmonic ratios to retain stable pitch tones. Some FM synths don't have these ratios which makes them less useful for harmonic sounds. I will be evaluating these aspects for each plugin.

<p>But first, lets look at some good emulations for reference. I'm focusing on free plugins here, but the Arturia DX7 V is decent if you got $200.

<h2>VOPMex</h2>
<p>This is kind of cheating because it uses a YM2151 (OPM) emulator, so it's very close to the real thing. It's quite accurate as well, but it hasn't really been updated in years. I used it in my track <a href=https://soundcloud.com/bryc/shoulders-of-giants>On the Shoulders of Giants</a>.

<p>To demonstrate the various FM synths, I'm using an excerpt of <i>Passing Breeze</i> from the OutRun arcade game.
It's a really well-done track using the YM2151 soundchip. The composer Hiroshi Kawaguchi employed a chorus effect by playing the melody with three slightly detuned voices, however I am only using a single voice on the lead, so it's cleaner than the original. But these are the <i>exact</i> patches and notes ripped directly from the game.

<p>Sounds just like the game, minus the drums. By the way, the FX stack I am using for all examples is a very light chorus, reverb/delay and a maximizer/limiter.

<h2>GENNY</h2>
<p>Another cheating emulator here, except this time it's a YM2612. It's beta vaporware, full of bugs, but seems to work for the most part. It's based on an accurate emulator at least. It is a very similar chip that sounds nearly identical to YM2151 when not using special features.

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-genny.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - GENNY</span></div>

<p>The sound is a bit more distorted/scratchy than VOPM, especially in the lead. For the most part, the instrument data is compatible so it sounds very similar. However I found that decreasing <code>TL</code> slightly in OP3&4 will eliminate the distortion to the point where it sounds indistinguishable from VOPM. But the audio above doesn't reflect these changes as I want to stress that manual adjustments may be required when converting YM2151->YM2612.

<h2>Dexed</h2>
<p>Dexed is an emulation of the original Yamaha DX7. It's easy on CPU due to not being a "real" emulator like the two above, yet it's still very accurate. It's also open source (like VOPM) which is always nice. I used DXconvert to convert the OPM data to the sysex format Dexed understands. It sounds quite off in the MarkI or OPL engine, only the Modern 24-bit one. Go figure.

<div id=x><audio controls><source src=music/fmtests_breeze-dexed.opus></audio> <span>Passing Breeze - Dexed</span></div>

<p>It's much more smooth than the original, but it gets close and is higher fidelity. It's quite interesting how effective conversion between different FM synths can be. Although I tried converting DX100 presets to YM2151, and they ended up a little muted. They're acceptable, but I have no idea how close they are.

<h2>Free FM synths</h2>
<p>Now that we've been spoiled by the top contenders, let's look at some free plugins that have their own flavor of FM. I will evaluate how close they can get to typical Yamaha FM sounds, as well as note any enhanced features that go beyond classic Yamaha FM, such as additional feedback, waveforms and algorithms/matrixes. So it wont be all bad.
